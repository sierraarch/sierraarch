    <h2>Social Implications</h2>
    <p>There is no doubt that America’s response to COVID-19 had many implications to our social interactions. With the new normal of social distancing and masking up, it is no longer the same to interact with each other as it was just last year. America decided to rapidly shutdown nearly everything as the months and cases progressed. Some argue that this is not healthy simply because we need to be able to communicate and interact with one another face to face. Others argue that this is absolutely the only way to condemn this virus once and for all and we need to “get over it”. </p>
    
    <h2>Economic Implications</h2>
    <p>America’s response to COVID-19 was certainly impactful on everyone. Many lost their jobs due to extended shutdowns or for not being considered essential. Our stock market also took a tremendous dive in all areas. Some believe that if our government would have taken swifter action on this pandemic, then we would not have suffered so many complications. Others believe that no matter how swift or slow our nation responded we would still end up in a crisis. The real problem is a huge chunk of our products come from China and with all of the shutdowns it caused a huge delay in imports. </p>
    
    <h2>Political Implications</h2>
    <p>Let’s face it our government is going to get judged no matter what they do or say. Just like with COVID-19, lots of people had a lot to say about the actions the government decided to take. Many lost trust in the government because they thought they acted poorly and not fast enough. They knew the seriousness of the situation, yet they waited months to officially enact different orders across the nation. Many other people believe that our government is doing great at handling the situation or they just simply think this whole thing is some kind of joke or hoax. </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>All in all, our nation certainly got some major judgement from their response to this new pandemic. Quite frankly I believe our government should have responded a lot quicker than they did, this then could have led to shorter/less shutdowns, less unemployment, and less conflict between Americans. Of course, with a new pandemic it is hard to know exactly how to react to and handle the situation, but our government could have implemented much better actions. Look at all the other countries they are doing much better than us. It just goes to show that our actions are very strong and influential on many lives. </p>
