Love & Faith

My vision for this project is to start a christian apparel business with an aesthetically pleasing website and brand colors. This is always something I've actually wanted to do as a second source of income.

Project Plan:
1. Create a line of products (sweaters, tees, hats, socks)
2. Price the products
3. Take product photos & make descriptions 
4. Create a easy to navigate website 
5. Showcase the brand's mission/story on the website
6. Provide a page that lists different Christian chairities to donate to

Our Story:
Love & Faith is all about offering affordable Christian apparel. We strive to create quality clothing with a sayings/scriptures that remind us of God's love. Our website showcases a simplistic design that matches our brand colors to solidify our brand identity. Our pages show our love for God and one another. We will be using different interactive components to enhance the customer experience.
